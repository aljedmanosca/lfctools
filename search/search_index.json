{"config":{"lang":["en"],"min_search_length":3,"prebuild_index":false,"separator":"[\\s\\-]+"},"docs":[{"location":"","text":"Welcome This is a documentation on the LFCTools. The LFCtools is an Excel addin which contains a collection of macros (or helpers) written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). These helpers perform task/s and do what should have been a long and repetitive action in a short time - with just a click of a button. The addin is designed to be unobtrusive yet always available if need arise. Installation Users can download the latest copy of the LFCTools through the repository . Updates and New versions are delivered in the same way . Method One Download the lfctools.zip file Open the zip file and extract the lfctools folder anywhere; preferrably your \"Downloads\" folder. Open the extracted lfctools folder and click the installer file. If everything goes well you should see a confirmation (see image below) A shortcut to the tool will be added in you desktop. Proceed to Post-Installation process . Method Two Download the lfctools-installer file Click the installer and follow the installation prompts. After successfull installation a shorcut will be added in you desktop. Proceed to Post-Installation process . Method Three If both of the above methods fail, we can resort to the manual method. Download the lfctools.zip file Open the zip file and extract the lfctools folder anywhere; preferrably your \"Downloads\" folder. Hit WIN + R and paste %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\AddIns then click \"OK\". Keep this folder open. Open the extracted lfctools folder and copy the following files: lfctools.ico lfctools.xlam lfctools.accdb defaultvalues.txt Paste the copied files in the folder from step 3 above. Click the lfctools file with the excel icon. Proceed to Post-Installation process . Post-Installation Process Launch the LFCTools by either clicking the desktop shorcut or the lfctools file. You should see the splashscreen indicating that the tool has been activated. Before proceeding set the LFCTools as an Add-in, this'll be a one-time process. In Excel navigate to: File > Options > Add-ins ; at the bottom of the page under \" Manage: \" click \" GO \" - the drop-down should be \"Excel Add-ins\" by default. You can also do this by combined keypress: ALT + T Then I . - In the Add-ins window check the box which says \"LFCTools\" then click \"OK\". The \"LFCTools\" tab will now be visible in the Excel ribbon. Please Note In rare instances the above guide might not work due to installation dependencies see Installation Dependencies for further information. Limitations The LFCTools is far from perfect. As of current the following are its limitations: No Undo - once a tool is executed there is no way to reverse or CTRL + Z your changes. It's a touch-move! Custom Templates - some campaigns require mapping for MLFs; this is something that the tool does not handle... yet . Changes - like everything else, the tools is not immune to changes. Most of the macros assume the placement of headers or columns if there are changes to the current reports that the Admin provide some the tools will also be affected. Known Issues In the course of development, the LFCTools have had some issues that still persist today. Although the tool is optimized regularly the issues are still experienced from time to time. Please keep the following issues in mind. Highlighter Crash - Using the highlighter when the some of the cells are hidden or filtered will cause Excel to crash. Find-Bug - There are instances when Excel's Find function can't seem to \"find\" things even if what's being looked-for is obvious ( or known ). This seems to have been rectified in one of the code optimization, still be on the lookout especially when checking TALs. Missing Addin - This was experienced during the early days of the tool where the addin goes missing. This has been rectified though it may happen to some lucky users in the future . Sluggish Excel - This too was experienced during the early days of the tool. The code optimization have improved the overall performance but might be experienced from time to time. Solution Should you experience the above issues try the \"reset\" tool under Miscelleanous . Better yet restart of the Excel application will solve the problem.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"This is a documentation on the LFCTools.
